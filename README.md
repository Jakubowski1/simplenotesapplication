Simple Notes Application

Tech Stack:
Language: TypeScript / JavaScript (ES6+)
Frontend: React.js 
Backend: Firebase
Database: Firestore

I have implemented application for handling notes.

● Used a public github repository. 
● Deployed to Firebase Hosting : https://simplenotesapplication-1.web.app

Implemented behaviours:

● To add a note just click on the first note and start typing. Then click save. 
● To edit a note just click on it and type. Then click save. 
● To delete a note click on trash bin. 
● Use search box to search by title. 
● At the bottom of every note you can see a timestamp. It will be new after updating a note. 
● Changes while updating the CRUD can be seen without reloading the page. 
● No possibility to add an empty note.
