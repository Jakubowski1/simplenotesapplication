Test Task: Trainee
Simple Notes Application
Execution time: ~ 8h
Duration: ~ 1w
Tech Stack:
Language: TypeScript / JavaScript (ES6+)
Frontend: React.js / Angular / Vue.js
Backend: Firebase/ Nest.js / Express.js / Python/ Golang / PHP
Database: MongoDB/ PostgresQL/MySQL / Firestore
Tools: Redux(Toolkit)/ Jotai, Mongoose, TypeORM, MaterialUI, Bootstrap + any other tool that can help
you implement this task
Basics:
● Use a public github repository.
● Public github repository must have README.MD with information about the test task,
running steps (optional: link to demo).
● Deploy the app to one of the following services: Github Pages, Firebase Hosting or any
other service you want
Behavioral:
After loading the main page the list of notes should be displayed. There should be 2 input fields
(for title and text) and a button “Add” to add a new note. Every note in the list should have a
“delete” button to delete a note.
Optional:

- Every note in the the list should have an “edit” button to edit a note
- Implement a search for notes by title or text.
- Each note should have a creation date.
  Functional:
  ● Design the application at your own discretion. Note that it should be rendered properly
  on any device including mobile phones and it should have a user friendly interface.
  ● It should be possible to add a note. When you click on the “add” button, a new note with
  the text from the input should be added to the list without page reloading.
  ● It should be possible to delete a note. When you click on the “delete” button, the note
  should be removed from the list without page reloading.
  Optional:
  *Disable adding notes with no text, add min and max characters
  *If you are implementing an “edit” button: when you click on it, the text of the corresponding note
  should appear in the input with the button “submit”. When you click “update” the text of the note
  in the list should be updated without page reloading.
  Assessment criteria:

1. The application should have a clear file structure (components, services, dtos, schemas
   ect should be placed in separate files/folders and had clear names).
2. All variables, classes etc should have clear and reasonable names.
3. If you are using TypeScript all variables, components, requests, responses and ect
   should be typed.
4. Layout should be adaptive and fit any screen.
5. The application must be error tolerant (It shouldn’t crash if something went wrong)
6. The application should be informative (In case of an error it should show the reason)
